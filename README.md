# Flow Go SDK [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk)

The Flow Go SDK provides a set of packages for Go developers to build applications that interact with the Flow network.

*Note: This SDK is also fully compatible with the [Flow Emulator](https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/docs/emulator.md) and can be used for local development.*

## What is Flow?

Flow is a new blockchain for open worlds. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/onflow/flow).

## Getting Started

### Installing

To start using the SDK, install Go 1.13 or above and run go get:

```sh
go get github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk
```

### Generating Keys

The signature scheme supported in Flow accounts is ECDSA. It can be coupled with the hashing algorithms SHA2-256 or SHA3-256.

Here's how to generate an ECDSA P-256 private key:

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/crypto"

// deterministic seed phrase
// note: this is only an example, please use a secure random generator for the key seed
seed := []byte("elephant ears space cowboy octopus rodeo potato cannon pineapple")

privateKey, err := crypto.GeneratePrivateKey(crypto.ECDSA_P256, seed)
```

The private key can then be encoded as bytes (i.e. for storage):

```go
encPrivateKey := privateKey.Encode()
```

A private key has an accompanying public key:

```go
publicKey := privateKey.PublicKey()
```

The example above uses an ECDSA key-pair of the elliptic curve P-256. Flow also supports the curve secp256k1. Here's how you can generate an `ECDSA-SECp256k1` private key:

```go
privateKey, err := crypto.GeneratePrivateKey(crypto.ECDSA_secp256k1, seed)
```

### Creating an Account

Once you have [generated a key-pair](#generating-keys), you can create a new account using its public key.

```go
import (
    "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk"
    "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/crypto"
    "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/templates"
)

ctx := context.Background()

// generate a new private key for the account
// note: this is only an example, please use a secure random generator for the key seed
seed := []byte("elephant ears space cowboy octopus rodeo potato cannon pineapple")
privateKey, _ := crypto.GeneratePrivateKey(crypto.ECDSA_P256, seed)

// get the public key
publicKey := privateKey.PublicKey()

// construct an account key from the public key
accountKey := flow.NewAccountKey().
    SetPublicKey(publicKey).
    SetHashAlgo(crypto.SHA3_256).             // pair this key with the SHA3_256 hashing algorithm
    SetWeight(flow.AccountKeyWeightThreshold) // give this key full signing weight

// generate an account creation script
// this creates an account with a single public key and no code
script, _ := templates.CreateAccount([]*flow.AccountKey{accountKey}, nil)

// connect to an emulator running locally
c, err := client.New("localhost:3569")
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to connect to emulator")
}

payer, payerKey, payerSigner := examples.RootAccount(c)

tx := flow.NewTransaction().
    SetScript(script).
    SetGasLimit(100).
    SetProposalKey(payer, payerKey.ID, payerKey.SequenceNumber).
    SetPayer(payer)

err = tx.SignEnvelope(payer, payerKey.ID, payerSigner)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to sign transaction")
}

err = c.SendTransaction(ctx, *tx)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to send transaction")
}

result, err := c.GetTransactionResult(ctx, tx.ID())
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to get transaction result")
}

var myAddress flow.Address

if result.Status == flow.TransactionStatusSealed {
    for _, event := range result.Events {
        if event.Type == flow.EventAccountCreated {
            accountCreatedEvent := flow.AccountCreatedEvent(event)
            myAddress = accountCreatedEvent.Address()
        }
	}
}
```

### Signing a Transaction

Below is a simple example of how to sign a transaction using a `crypto.PrivateKey`:

```go
import (
    "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk"
    "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/crypto"
)

var (
    myAddress    flow.Address
    myAccountKey flow.AccountKey
    myPrivateKey crypto.PrivateKey
)

tx := flow.NewTransaction().
    SetScript(script).
    SetGasLimit(100).
    SetProposalKey(myAddress, myAccountKey.ID, myAccountKey.SequenceNumber).
    SetPayer(myAddress)
```

Transaction signing is done using the `crypto.Signer` interface. The simplest (and least secure) implementation of
`crypto.Signer` is `crypto.InMemorySigner`.

Signatures can be generated more securely using hardware keys stored in a device such as an [HSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module). The `crypto.Signer` interface is intended to be flexible enough to support a variety of signer implementations and is not limited to in-memory implementations.

```go
// construct a signer from your private key and configured hash algorithm
mySigner := crypto.NewInMemorySigner(myPrivateKey, myAccountKey.HashAlgo)

err := tx.SignEnvelope(myAddress, myAccountKey.ID, mySigner)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to sign transaction")
}
```

#### How Signatures Work in Flow

Flow introduces new concepts that allow for more flexibility when creating and signing transactions. Before trying the examples below, we recommend that you read through the [transaction signature documentation](https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/docs/accounts-and-keys.md#signing-a-transaction).

##### Single party, single signature

TODO: add example

##### Single party, multiple signatures

TODO: add example

##### Multiple parties

### Sending a Transaction

You can submit a transaction to the network using the Access API client.

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

// connect to an emulator running locally
c, err := client.New("localhost:3569")
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to connect to emulator")
}

ctx := context.Background()

err = c.SendTransaction(ctx, tx)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to send transaction")
}
```

### Querying Transaction Results

After you have submitted a transaction, you can query its status by ID:

```go
result, err := c.GetTransactionResult(ctx, tx.ID())
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to fetch transaction result")
}
```

The result includes a `Status` field that will be one of the following values:
- `UNKNOWN` - The transaction has not yet been seen by the network.
- `PENDING` - The transaction has not yet been included in a block.
- `FINALIZED` - The transaction has been included in a block.
- `EXECUTED` - The transaction has been executed but the result has not yet been sealed.
- `SEALED` - The transaction has been executed and the result is sealed in a block.

```go
if result.Status == flow.TransactionStatusSealed {
  fmt.Println("Transaction is sealed!")
}
```

The result also contains an `Error` that holds the error information for a failed transaction.

```go
if result.Error != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Transaction failed with error: %v\n", result.Error)
}
```

### Querying Blocks

You can use the `GetLatestBlock` method to fetch the latest sealed or unsealed block:

```go
// fetch the latest sealed block
isSealed := true
latestBlock, err := c.GetLatestBlock(ctx, isSealed)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to fetch latest sealed block")
}

// fetch the latest unsealed block
isSealed := false
latestBlock, err := c.GetLatestBlock(ctx, isSealed)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to fetch latest unsealed block")
}
```

A block contains the following fields:

- `ID` - The ID (hash) of the block.
- `ParentBlockID` - The ID of the previous block in the chain.
- `Height` - The height of the block in the chain.
- `CollectionGuarantees` - The list of collections included in the block.

### Executing a Script

You can use the `ExecuteScriptAtLatestBlock` method to execute a read-only script against the latest sealed execution state.

This functionality can be used to read state from the blockchain.

Scripts must be in the following form:

- A single `main` function with a single return value

This is an example of a valid script:

```
fun main(): Int { return 1 }
```

```go
import "github.com/onflow/cadence"

script := []byte("fun main(): Int { return 1 }")

value, err := c.ExecuteScript(ctx, script)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to execute script")
}

ID := value.(cadence.Int)

// convert to Go int type
myID := ID.Int()
```

### Querying Events

You can query events with the `GetEventsForHeightRange` function:

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

blocks, err := c.GetEventsForHeightRange(ctx, client.EventRangeQuery{
    Type:       "flow.AccountCreated",
    StartHeight: 10,
    EndHeight:   15,
})
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to query events")
}
```

#### Event Query Format

An event query includes the following fields:

**Type**

The event type to filter by. Event types are namespaced by the account and contract in which they are declared.

For example, a `Transfer` event that was defined in the `Token` contract deployed at account `0x55555555555555555555` will have a type of `A.0x55555555555555555555.Token.Transfer`.

Read the [language documentation](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/blob/master/docs/language.md#events) for more information on how to define and emit events in Cadence.

**StartHeight, EndHeight**

The blocks to filter by. Events will be returned from blocks in the range `StartHeight` to `EndHeight`, inclusive.

#### Event Results

The `GetEventsForHeightRange` function returns events grouped by block. Each block contains a list of events matching the query in order of execution.

```go
for _, block := range blocks {
    fmt.Printf("Events for block %s:\n", block.BlockID)
    for _, event := range block.Events {
        fmt.Printf(" - %s", event)
    }
}
```

### Querying Accounts

You can query the state of an account with the `GetAccount` function:

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk"

address := flow.HexToAddress("01")

account, err := c.GetAccount(ctx, address)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to fetch account")
}
```

A `flow.Account` contains the following fields:

- `Address: flow.Address` - The account address.
- `Balance: uint64` - The account balance.
- `Code: []byte` - The code deployed at this account.
- `Keys: []flow.AccountKey` - A list of the public keys associated with this account.
