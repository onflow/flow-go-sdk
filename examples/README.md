# Emulator Examples

This package contains code samples that interact with the Flow Emulator.

## Running the emulator with the Flow CLI

The emulator is bundled with the Flow CLI, a command-line interface for working with Flow.

### Installation

Follow [these steps](../../../cli/README.md) to install the Flow CLI.

### Starting the server

Start the emulator by running the following command _in this directory_:	

```shell script	
flow emulator start -v

# The -v flag enables verbose log output, which is useful for testing
```

## Running the examples

In separate process, run any of the example programs below. Watch the emulator logs to see transaction output.

```shell script
# Create a new account
GO111MODULE=on go run ./create_account/main.go
```

```shell script
# Add a key to an existing account
GO111MODULE=on go run ./add_account_key/main.go
```

```shell script
# Deploy a contract
GO111MODULE=on go run ./deploy_contract/main.go
```

```shell script
# Query events
GO111MODULE=on go run ./query_events/main.go
```
