# Protobuf

This folder contains the [protocol buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) files that define the Access gRPC API. 

## Generating stubs

You can use [prototool](https://github.com/uber/prototool) to generate gRPC client stubs in Go:

```shell script
prototool generate
```
